**WELCOME!**

If you came to this page from the sign on the arcade cabinet at Full Tilt, read on to find out more
information about the game in that cabinet! The type of game is an "STG", a genre which you can learn more
about [here](/whatis/).

Ketsui
------

The STG that is currently featured at Full Tilt Ballard is **Ketsui**. For a great write up of this
game, [read this](http://www.hardcoregaming101.net/ketsui/ketsui.htm)!

As far as we know, this is the *only* arcade in the United States where you can play this game! It's
not often you see this game outside of Japan!

Strategies
----------

For more information on how to play the game and various strategies for survival and score, [this
thread](http://shmups.system11.org/viewtopic.php?f=5&t=5123) on the
[Shmups Forum](http://shmups.system11.org/) is very helpful.

Meetups
--------

Currently, folks from Northwest STG try to meet up at Full Tilt Ballard every **Tuesday** starting
at around 7:30pm and we usually stick around until at least 10pm. If you are curious about STGs at
all or want to show us a thing or two, please stop and say hi! We're always excited to meet new
people!

About Full Tilt
---------

[Full Tilt Ice Cream](http://fulltilticecream.com) in
[Ballard](http://www.yelp.com/biz/full-tilt-ice-cream-seattle-5) is a really neat place that mostly
caters to pinball players with really well maintained pinball machines, but they also have a few
arcade machines.  There are multiple locations, but for the Ballard location the operator is
[20XX Amusements](https://www.facebook.com/20XXamusements) who caters to more obscure genres and
enjoys providing games that you will not find hardly anywhere else. Some of us have known Bobby for
years and he has been nice enough to let us rotate out STGs in a candy cab at Full Tilt. We are
very excited about having an arcade where we can meet up regularly and play games!
