I've been working on a streaming setup lately for streaming shmups and other arcade stuff. People
came over to watch the [100 Yen: The Japanese Arcade Experience](http://www.100yenfilm.com/) documentary and we gave the setup a
spin and this is what happened. Super fun, none of us had really played [Cardinal Sins](http://www.shmups.com/reviews/cardinalsins/index.html) except for
KevinDDR so he gave us the rundown and we had a little mini-tournament.

**Final scores:**
- KevinDDR - KCB - 58,779,110
- Marus - MPO - 54,426,830
- EPS21 - EPS - 46,286,420
- Tadaru - ATT - 44,076,590
- pdp80 - PDP - 41,325,530
